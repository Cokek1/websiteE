            <p>My goal for the scripts section is to provide C# Unity Scripts that I have not been able to find anywhere else on the internet for other people to use for completely free.</p>

            <h2>Games</h2>
            <p>The games I make might feel incomplete. however they are simply used as sandboxes for me where I can test and improve my skills. I have put them on this website for public use, and so that it is more convenent for some of my playtesters to access them.</p>
