            <h2>Divorced Shooters</h2>
            <p>Divorced Shooters is my first unity project that I designed for a class I took in early 2021 called "Game Design''. I worked on it for 2 months straight then I took a long break because I got burnt out. Before I knew it it was around the last 2 months of school and I had to hurry to add more components and features before the due date. For the time crunch I had I would have to say that I am pretty proud of myself for adding what I added especially because it was my first game. don't go into playing this game expecting it to be triple A quality it is pretty buggy and you might need to relaunch the game multiple times during a play session. Below I have provided the link to the drive folder the game.
